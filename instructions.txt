Hello!

This is a coding opportunity to show us what you know and how you work.  This
is a simple order form that calculates price based on numer of requested items
 that includes very little extra.  In this, please work through the task list
below and try not to spend more than 3 hours working on this.  Be sure to note
 what time you start so you can let us know how much time you spent.  In doing
 so, think of how to do things the right way vs just getting it done as this
helps us understand what you would do on the job for us.  It is more important
 to focus on staying within 3 hours than completing all of the tasks.

 Task list:
 1) Add a new option for hamburger for $2.50.
 2) Add 7.5% tax to order total.
 3) Add some backend validation.
 4) Add Ketchup as an option where relevant.
 5) Add some styling (nothing too extravagant).
 6) Add frontend validation (prior to actually submitting the form)
 After above, feel free to make other improvements!
